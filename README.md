🍊 CitrusGS: Framework Overview
CitrusGS is a comprehensive framework designed for the reconstruction, segmentation and phenotyping of citrus fruit. 
It uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which is faster and often more accurate than traditional NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields) for this type of geometry.
Key Features
1.A 3DGS-based framework for high-fidelity citrus CT reconstruction.
2.Enables automated organ-level segmentation and phenotypic trait extraction for citrus fruit.
3.Demonstrates high robustness across diverse cultivars and defective samples. 

**Note:** The data, model weights, and core code are currently being organized and will be released soon.
